# Purpose and Scope

The app I have chosen to develop is a simulation that involves you looking after a new kitten. This app was designed to have an in-depth experience on what it's truly like to be a kittens parent .I have implemented features such as feeding , playing and annoying the kitten with statuses. Depending on the users choices these statuses will either increase or decrease depending on what is chosen if not chosen strategically the user will hit a limit and the game will either end in a win or loss.

## Reason for creating KittenCare

Looking after an animal is a truly daunting experience especially if you have little to no experience in that field but what if there was a way to have the same experience with no risk? that's where I come in with KittenCare. This app not only gives real life experience to new pet owners but it also gives them a taste of reality to see if they are ready to dedicate a part of their life to keeping a little kitten happy and healthy. Other than gaining experience this app can also be used for families that aren't able to own pets due to living or financial status.

## Features

-   Playing
    By default A kitten has a lot of energy and will need you to be able to take time out of your day to play with it so why not implement that into the game?. As fun as it is playing with a kitten in this simulation if played with too much its energy bar will be depleated which will lead to you losing the game.

-   Feeding
    As every other pet or living creature food is a necessity you will be given the option to feed the kitten as much as you want but if you're not careful on how much you feed it you will soon find out that too much food will equal a loss as your kitten will become unhealthy and too chunky to move.

-   Annoying
    Like every other thing if annoyed too much your kitten will become hostile this will give you the feeling of limitation to see how far you can push your kitten until it snaps if pushed too far you will be given a loss and a few scratch marks while you're there

-   Cuddling
    Cuddling your cute new kitten is an obvious must for a lot of reasons cuddling will have your kitten gain trust it would be able to relax and gain more energy for their little adventures and eventually will gain more affection towards you but if smothered too much the kitten will soon be repulsed and want nothing to do with you resulting in a loss

-   Kitten statuses
    Energy , hunger and boredom levels statuses are incorperated into the app to keep track on how far you can go the statuses show how bored , hungry or energetic the kitten is and depending on which is higher or lower will equal what your next choice should be.
